        Following the move of the Portuguese Legend, Cristiano Ronaldo, in the
        summer of 2023, ex-European team players like Otávio, Sadio Mané,
        Aymeric Laporte, Seko Fofana, Marcelo Brozovic and Alex Telles joined.
        With the already won Arab Club Champions Cup trophy, Al Nassr and
        Cristiano Ronaldo look to win more domestic and continental trophies. At
        the end of the 2023 year, Al Nassr are 2nd in the league, trailing only
        Al Hilal. They finished 1st and unbeaten in their AFC Champions League
        group drawing Saudi Club Al-Fayha FC in the RO16. Talisca currently sits
        1st in the golden boot standings of the AFC Champions League with 8
        goals in just the group stage. Al Nassr have qualified to the
        semi-finals of the Kings Cup after beating Saudi heavy weights Al Shabab
        FC 5–1.

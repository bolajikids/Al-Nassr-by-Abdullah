      <h2>The End of Abdul Majed Era (1989–2000)</h2>
      <p>
        In the 1990s (year), Al Nassr managed to win two further Saudi Premier
        League titles in 1993-1994 and 1994–1995 season, 1990 King's Cup and
        1997-1998 Federation Cup. Towards the end of Majed Abdullah's career, he
        still wasn't able to lift the ultimate prize in UAFA region; the Arab
        Club Champions Cup while the other top clubs in Saudi already succeeded
        in doing this. Despite that, AFC Al Nassr managed triumph in the
        continental tournaments. 37 Years old striker Majed Abdullah at the time
        managed to win two GCC Club Cups, one Asian Cup Winners' Cup and one
        Asian Super Cup. Majed Abdullah announced his retirement on 12 April
        1998 following Al-Nassr's win in the 1998 Asian Cup Winner's Cup against
        Suwon Samsung Bluewings from South Korea in front of 70,000 fans in
        Riyadh. Majed retired at 39 years old as the all-time top scorer of the
        Saudi League with 189 goals and is also Al-Nassr's all-time top scorer
        with 260 goals. A record that was considered untouchable until the
        coming of Abderrazak Hamdallah After becoming champion of Asian Super
        Cup, Al Nassr were eligible to represent the AFC region in the first
        FIFA Club World Cup Brazil 2000. In that championship Al Nassr played
        against Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, Real Madrid and Raja
        Casablanca, and finished 3rd in the group. Al Nassr won the
        competition's Fair Play award.

        After the Golden Trio's retirement, Al Nassr's fresh squad at the time
        made an impressive performance during their first run in the FIFA Club
        World Cup. The Club then went on to sign some internationally recognized
        players, such as Ivory Coast's Fadel Keïta and former Barcelona
        Attacking Midfielder Julio César Baldivieso. Despite the expensive
        signings at the time, Al-Nassr failed to keep their position in the
        league and soon received some major setbacks. Things got worse as the
        next season went by. In 2006–07, the club only managed to avoid
        relegation on their last day of the season, which prompted honorary
        members including the legendary Majed Abdullah to intervene. Their plan
        was to begin an effective long-term plan to restructure the new
        management.

      <h2>The Age of the 3 Strikers (2015–2022)</h2>
      <p>
        The 2010s marked the growth of football in most of Asian countries both
        in league quality and its national team. The AFC Champions League also
        started to spark interest among football enthusiasts worldwide. In the
        2014–15 season, Al Nassr continued to defend their title as champions,
        by winning the league. However the team kept failing to get their treble
        after losing in the King's Cup final, as well as only reaching the Crown
        Prince's semi-final. Their hope of returning as champions they once were
        was still far under their grasp. Many fans felt let down by their club
        after losing in the group stage of the AFC Champions League against
        Bunyodkor from Uzbekistan, Al Duhail and Persepolis. Al Sahlawi, who was
        27 years old at the time was only able to score 25 goals from his 37
        appearance that season. For these reasons, the coach was replaced by the
        former Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita. Even with the Trickster
        training the team, Al Nassr still failed to break through the AFC
        Champions League. After being defeated by Al Duhail and Zob Ahan, Al
        Nassr finally defeated their opponent in which they lost to in the
        previous championship Bunyodkor back to back. The start of 2016–2017
        season marked the transfers of two Croatian players into the club: Ivan
        Tomecak and Marin Tomasov, who were loaned to Al Nassr. Abdullah Madu, a
        new center-back at the time also started playing with the club. In this
        season however, the club only got 3rd position in Roshn Saudi League,
        behind their El Classico rival Al Ahli and city rival Al Akhdhoud. Al
        Nassr only finished second in the Crown Prince Cup that season, losing
        to Al Hilal once more. They were also runner up to Al Ahli in the final
        of Kings Cup. Al Nassr failed to qualify for the AFC Champions League
        2017 and the AFC Champions League 2018. In 2015–2016 season, Sahlawi
        score 10 goals in his 29 appearance. In the season 2016–2017, Sahlawi
        only scored 11 goals in his 27 appearance and for the next season 12
        goals from 24 appearance. Sahlawi score 33 goal in span of 3 years. Al
        Nassr coach Gustavo Quinteros from Bolivia, decided to sign Wingback
        Sultan Al Ghannam on 12 March 2018 for a free transfer from Al Faisaly.
        Ghannam quickly proved his talent by becoming a key player for in the
        defence and offence. The club also signed arguably the two best Moroccan
        Player's at the time, Abderrazek Hamdallah and Nordin Amrabat. Both of
        them joined in the Saudi Professional League on 16 July and 23 August
        2018. Hamdallah once play for Aalesund FK in Norwegian League and
        Guangzhou R&F in Chinese League. The nicknamed executioner proved
        himself to be a menace when he made his debut against Al Qadsiah FC,
        making two assists. In his second match, he scored his first goal for
        the club against Al Taawoun FC. After this, Sahlawi's position as club
        favourite striker began to slowly shift into Hamdallah as the former
        Chinese League star player adapted with his teammates. The Moroccan
        Forward broke the record since the league became professional in 2007
        and carrying his team to qualify for 2019 AFC Champions League by
        defeating FK AGMK Olmaliq. In the 2019 AFC Champions League, Al Nassr
        managed to secure 2nd position just below Zob Ahan and advancing past
        the round of sixteen with Hamdallah scoring. In the quarter final, Al
        Nassr were defeated by Al Sadd 4–3. Hamdallah scored 4 goals in the 2019
        AFC Champions League. Despite the bad start due to a previous ankle
        injury, Hamadallah was able to end his first season in the Saudi
        Professional League as the top scorer after impressively scoring 34
        goals. By this time, Hamdalllah completely replaced Sahlawi as the main
        striker. In the 2018–19 Season he won the league title with his team. He
        scored a record of 34 goals with his teammate Nordin Amrabat. He scored
        in the final match against Al Batin. On 3 January 2019, Hamdallah scored
        his first hat-trick for the club against Al Jandal SC in Round of 64 in
        the 2019 King Cup. 10 days later, he scored a super hat-trick against Al
        Ansar FC. He scored consecutive super hat-trick's against Al-Fayha FC in
        the Round of 16. On 27 April 2019, Hamdallah scored a double in a 4–2
        loss in the semi-final against Al Ittihad of the 2019 King Cup. By the
        end of 2019, Hamdallah managed to beat several stars such as Robert
        Lewandowski and Lionel Messi as the world's top scorer, noted by IFFHS,
        after reaching 57 goals in the year. Al Sahlawi also left the club to
        join Al-Shabab. On 4 January 2020, Hamdallah scored in a 1–1 draw
        against Al Taawoun FC to win the 2019 Saudi Super Cup. On 30 January
        2021, Hamdallah scored in a 3–0 victory against Al Hilal SFC to win the
        2020 Saudi Super Cup.

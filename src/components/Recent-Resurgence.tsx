      <h2>Recent resurgence (2008–2015)</h2>
      <p>
        After a major overhaul of playing staff, Al Nassr went on to win the
        Federation Cup 2008 against city rivals, Al-Hilal. In the next season,
        Al Nassr made a record breaking transfer by signing young Al Sahlawi
        from Al Qadsiah in 2009 for SR32 million ($8 million) fee, breaking
        Yasser Al-Qahtani's record from Al Hilal from the same team as Sahlawi.
        Yasser record transfer are $2,5 million fee, he is also regarded as the
        best player in Asia defeating Nashat Akram and Younis Mahmoud whose
        national team clinching victory at 2007 Asian Cup. Newly reformed Al
        Nassr put lots of hope on their young striker's shoulders. In his first
        season with Al-Nassr, Al-Sahlawi scored 21 goals in 36 matches and
        received the Young Player of the Year award from STC. However, the club
        only finished third in 2009–10. Despite that, Al Nassr were eligible to
        secure a place in the Asian Champions League for the following season.

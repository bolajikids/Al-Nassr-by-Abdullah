      <p>
        On 30 December 2022, Al Nassr signed Cristiano Ronaldo after the
        Portuguese player left Manchester United by mutual agreement. Ronaldo's
        contract runs for two-and-a-half years until summer 2025, with a total
        salary of €200 million per year, thought to be the highest ever paid to
        a professional footballer. He made an immediate impact on the global
        following of the club, with their Instagram account growing from 860000
        followers before his move to over 23 million followers as of Jan 4,
        2024.[4] Al Nassr finished in second place in the 2022–23 season.

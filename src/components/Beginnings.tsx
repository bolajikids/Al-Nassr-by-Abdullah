        Al-Nassr Football Club, better known as Al-Nassr, is a Saudi Arabian
        football club based in the city of Riyadh. Formed in 1955, the club
        plays its home games at Al-Awwal Park Stadium. Its main colors are
        yellow and blue. Al Nassr was established in 1955 by the Al-Ja’ba
        brothers. Training took place in an old playground at Gashlat Al-Shortah
        west of Al-Fotah Garden where there was a small football field and a
        small room to store balls and shirts. In addition to the Al-Ja'ba
        brothers, Ali and Al-Owais. Prince Abdul Rahman bin Saud Al Saud became
        the head of Al Nassr, he spent more than 39 years as the president for 3
        stints till his death. His love of the team made him accept the
        challenge of being the president of a second division club and turning
        it to a champion and for threason he is known as Al Nassr's Godfather.
        They were promoted to the first division in 1963. During the 1970s and
        1980s, the club won four Saudi Premier League titles, six King's Cups,
        three Crown Prince Cups, and three Federation Cups. The team's success
        was built around the "Saudi Golden Trio" of Majed Abdullah, Fahd
        Al-Herafy and Mohaisn Al-Jam'aan.
